# Fish-Classfication-using-Transfer-Learning-of-Pre-trained-Models
This project classifies fish species (Bodianus, Coris, Epinephelus, Halichoeres, Lethrinus, Lutjanus, Pseudanthias, Thalassoma) from the QUT dataset using pretrained models weights: 1-VGG-16 2-VGG-29 3-AlexNet And then proposing a new architecture model and comparing the results with the pretrained models Next, We do Transfer Learning to this proposed model to classify a new class of fish (Tilapia)
