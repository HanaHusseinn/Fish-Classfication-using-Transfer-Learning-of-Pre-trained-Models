# Fish Classfication using Transfer Learning of Pre-trained Models in Machine Learning

This project classifies 8 fish species (Bodianus, Coris, Epinephelus, Halichoeres, Lethrinus, Lutjanus, Pseudanthias, Thalassoma) from the QUT dataset using pretrained models weights transfer learning: 


1-VGG-16 (Keras)

2-VGG-29 (Keras)

3-AlexNet (Pytorch)


And then proposing a new architecture model and comparing the results with the pretrained models


Next, We do Transfer Learning to this proposed model to classify a new class of fish (Tilapia) to have 9 species of fish


Note: Each of the species has different subspecies which are used duirng training and testing.
